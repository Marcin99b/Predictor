# Use Cases

## House buying
"I want a $400k house. When will I have 20% down?"

You are earning $8k per month, spending $6k, and have $25k saved. Enter your numbers and Predictor shows you will hit $80k (20% down) in exactly 27.5 months. Now you can plan accordingly instead of hoping it works out.

## Emergency fund planning
"How long until I have 6 months of expenses saved?"

Your monthly expenses are $4,500, so you need $27k total. Currently saving $800/month with $5k already set aside. Predictor calculates you'll reach your goal in 27.5 months, accounting for any irregular income or expense changes you've planned.

## Career transition
"If I take this lower-paying job, how will it affect my car purchase timeline?"

Compare scenarios: current job vs. new job with $1k less monthly income. See exactly how much longer you will need to save for that $25k car, helping you make an informed decision about the career move.

## Debt freedom
"When will I be completely debt-free?"

Enter all your loans with their payment schedules. See not just when each individual debt disappears, but how your cash flow improves month by month as payments end, and when you'll have true financial freedom.
