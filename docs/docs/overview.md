# Predictor

**"When will I be able to afford that house?"**

Predictor simulates your budget months into the future, accounting for your salary, expenses, and life events.

## The Problem

You want to buy something expensive but don't know when you'll have enough money. Maybe it's a house down payment, a new car, or just building an emergency fund.

Budget apps show you where your money *went*, but won't tell you when you'll hit your savings goals. Spreadsheets work but become a mess when you have irregular income, loans that end, or seasonal expenses.

## What Predictor Does

Predictor takes the uncertainty out of long-term planning by showing you exactly when you'll reach your goals.

- Income that changes over time (raises, contract work ending)
- Expenses that disappear (when you finish paying off that car loan)
- Irregular costs (annual insurance, quarterly taxes)
- Unexpected events (tax refunds, emergency repairs)

You'll get a clear timeline instead of guesswork.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marcin99b/Predictor.git
cd predictor/src
dotnet run --project Predictor.Web
```

Open `https://localhost:7176/swagger` and try it with the built-in example data.

*Docker support is available but optional - see Dockerfile in the project.*
